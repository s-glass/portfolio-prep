## Tell me about yourself

1. A two or three word catchy title. Do NOT use cliches like “programming ninja” or “coding rockstar”.

**Communication, Collaboration, & Coding**


2. A personal headline, like you have atop your LinkedIn page. What do you want your career to be about?

**Forward-thinking software developer skilled in communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and language learning. I enjoy collaborating to find solutions, facilitating successful teamwork, and achieving goals effectively and creatively.**


3. Your professional pitch: You’ve done a recording, so just write down here how it goes.

**I’m currently a student developer at Code Fellows, and I’m making a transition to software development from social work, teaching abroad, and marketing. I was inspired to learn coding from my previous work in digital marketing, which allowed me to work closely with a team of software devs and see the impact of their work, in addition to managing a web product that publishes information about coding bootcamps. After experiencing a layoff from that job, I knew coding was where I wanted to pivot my career towards.**

**Some of my strongest skill sets revolve around communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and language learning, which I’m excited to bring to my new role as a software developer. In addition to tech languages like JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, I am proficient in English, Spanish, and Swedish.** 

**After building up my network and experience, my ultimate goal is to find a position that will allow me to blend software development with the perspective and insight I’ve gained from the worlds of social work and education. What excites me the most about moving into software development is the potential to create opportunities that people wouldn’t otherwise have access to, along with using tech skills to create tools for greater social inclusion and equity.**
